A boosting algorithm to implement a mobile APP-based language learning system,"Chen W.-L., Wu Y.-C., Yang J.C.","In this study, we proposed a mobile APP-based system which integrates story-based animations and simulation quizzes for English learning. Users could interact with both components of the app. The story-based animation component provides the function of word/phrase reading which displays short animation clips. For the simulation quiz component, a number of simulated quizzes are presented. The app automatically displays the scores obtained upon completion of the quiz, and regenerates another quiz based on the student's performance in the preceding quiz and the proposed boosting algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, we conducted an experiment which compares the proposed system with traditional class-based learning. The results of the experiment show that the proposed mobile learning system yields superior scores to the control group. The results suggest the APP-based learning is helpful for students to improve their English skills. Statistical analyses demonstrate that the proposed APP-based system significantly outperforms the control group. Finally, the satisfaction survey also showed that users are highly satisfied with the mobile APP-based language learning system.",404,404,2015,"Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computers in Education, ICCE 2015",,,Scopus
A Flipped Contextual Game-Based Learning Approach to Enhancing EFL Students' English Business Writing Performance and Reflective Behaviors,"Lin, Chi-Jen; Hwang, Gwo-Jen; Fu, Qing-Ke; Chen, Jing-Fang","English business writing is an important and challenging course for English as Foreign Language (EFL) students since it is not only related to English writing skills, but also to business knowledge. Context-gamebased learning seems to be a good approach to situating students in a meaningful and interesting practicing environment, which could improve their learning motivation and interest. However, without interacting with the teacher and peers, the effectiveness of game-based learning could be limited. In this study, a flipped contextual game-based learning approach was proposed to cope with this problem; moreover, a mixed methods research approach was used to analyze the writing performance, writing errors, and reflective content of the students who learned with the proposed approach and those learning with conventional contextual game-based learning. The experimental results revealed that the flipped contextual game-based instruction was able to enhance the students' English writing performance. It was also found that those students with the flipped learning approach had fewer writing errors than those learning with the conventional approach. Moreover, by analyzing the students' reflective content, the benefits and challenges of flipping the classroom are reported. These findings could be valuable references for those who intend to conduct effective flipped contextual game-based learning with learning management systems to motivate students' game-based learning and to improve their language learning performance.","Inclusion:

A gamified community for fostering learning engagement towards preventing Early school leaving,"Tsalapatas H., Heidmann O., Alimisi R., Koutsaftikis D., Tsalapatas S., Houstis E.","Early school leaving is a complex phenomenon that may adversely affect on a learner’s future development. ESL is the result of a combination of factors, such as insufficient school curricula understanding, low value placed on education by families, unavailability or low capacity of parents to support learners in schooling, insufficient parent-teacher-learner communication, and more. Many factors are socio-economic and are related to the extended social environment of learners. This work aims at strengthening the ties of school networks aiming at preventing ESL risk factors to set root in a learner’s life through early interventions that start in primary school. This is pursued through a gamified school community and supporting gamified complementary to school curricula learning activities that aim at fostering engagement of parents, teachers, and learners. The community promotes a sense of affiliation, opens-up communication channels, and promotes a positive school environment for the benefit of learners and their parents. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2016.","Inclusion:

A Mahjong-like game of English vocabulary spelling,"Tsai C.-Y., Hsu J.-M., Tsai H.-H., Yu P.-T., Huang W.-F.","With rapid development of the world globalization, the role of English has become an international language for people conversation. In fact, people know it but they often have no good ways to learn English efficiently. Sometimes, some people think that the procedure of learning English is boring. Therefore, it is an important issue how to engage and encourage people to effectively learn English. Many researches and experiments had indicated that the game-based learning is a joyful approach for learning. Chinese Mahjong is a traditional Chinese game for gambling and entertainment. The game rule of Mahjong is to collect the related cards combining a card sequence or the same cards in a triple pair. In the same, spelling the English vocabulary is also combined the letters to form a word. Thus, this paper tries to design and implement a Mahjong-like multi-party game spelling the English vocabulary for learners in English learning. That is, the learners play the game with other peer learners via the Internet to promote their spelling abilities of English vocabulary in multi-party networked game. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","Inclusion:

A Mobile Game-Based English Vocabulary Practice System Based on Portfolio Analysis,"Wu, Ting-Ting; Huang, Yueh-Min","English learning has become a vital educational strategy in many non-English-speaking countries. Vocabulary is a critical element for language learners. Therefore, developing sufficient vocabulary knowledge enables effective communication. However, learning a foreign language is difficult and stressful. In addition, memorizing English vocabulary is often considered boring, and learners may lack motivation for learning activities. To increase English learning motivation and interest, this study constructed a mobile game-based English vocabulary practice system that entails selecting words according to textbook passages, a difficulty ratio, and learning portfolios. The learning activities involved in the system transform vocabulary learning from tedious memorization to game-based learning, thereby enhancing learners' vocabulary memory and their familiarity with curriculum-related vocabulary through various multimedia. An experiment was conducted by dividing students into three groups that involved different vocabulary review methods. All students had similar English proficiency levels, and the course content and instructor were the same for all groups. This study statistically analyzed whether learners become familiar with vocabulary after playing the game. According to the analysis results, students who used the proposed system exhibited higher learning interest, attention, and learning effectiveness, as well as a sense of accomplishment and triumph, compared with other students.","Inclusion:

A mobile instructional pervasive game method for language learning,"Chang, Ching; Shih, Ju-Ling; Chang, Chih-Kai","In this paper, a mobile instructional pervasive game (M-IPG) learning method is proposed for improving students' learning achievements with respect to vocabulary, grammar, reading, and writing. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in an EFL course at a university school. A total of 137 university students participated in the experiment, 67 of whom were assigned to the experimental group and followed with the M-IPG approach, whilst 70 students were in the control group and was taught with the mobile inquiry-based instruction. From the empirical obtained, it was found that the proposed approach could effectively promote students' learning achievement, as well as decrease their cognitive load of learning and perceptions of the use of M-IPG learning. It was found from the interviews that most of the participants perceived the M-IPG learning method to be a stimulating though challenging learning task that facilitated them in improving their location-based learning in the aspects of language learning and practice, learning contents recall, and confidence in using the language.","Inclusion:

A physical interactive game for learning English of children,"Shin S.-I., Park K.","As English is the universal language used by international society with immense interest, we ought to seek for more effective teaching method. One way to reach such goal is to utilize a physical interactive game in teaching English. A physical interactive game encourages the spontaneous activity in learning without the psychological burden while promoting interest in English and basic usage of English. Also, physical movement interface can stimulate learners' motivation while inducing positive response in interest and immersion. In this thesis, we will design interface using 3D depth camera to produce a physical interactive game for learning English of children by capturing the movement of children and creating a gesture that will trigger children's interest. Also, we will create a physical interactive game environment high in user interaction with the content and apply such method to introduce prototype of English learning game. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.","Inclusion:

Adaptive systems as enablers of feedback in English language learning game-based environments,"Gavriushenko M., Karilainen L., Kankaanranta M.","This paper presents perspectives on adaptive web-based learning environments, their tasks, functions, techniques and methods. The main categories, types and layers of adaptive learning systems as well as different forms of feedback used in these environments were examined. The significance of feedback becomes emphasized in learning environments because it helps to plan the student's learning path, provide information about their progress, note the important information and guide the student along the learning process. This work introduces an evaluation framework for the analysis of game-based learning environments by the main criteria used in adaptive learning games. The analysis is focused on various learning environments, specifically applications and games for English language learning. The analysis results in an evaluation of 23 game-based learning environments and applications that are developed for the purposes of English learning.

Affect and willingness to communicate in digital game-based learning,"Reinders, Hayo; Wattana, Sorada","The possible benefits of digital games for language learning and teaching have received increasing interest in recent years. Games are said, amongst others, to be motivating, to lower affective barriers in learning, and to encourage foreign or second language (L2) interaction. But how do learners actually experience the use of games? What impact does gameplay have on students' perceptions of themselves as learners, and how does this affect their learning practice? These questions are important as they are likely to influence the success of digital game-based language learning, and as a result the way teachers might integrate games into the curriculum. In this study we investigated the experiences of five students who had participated in a fifteen-week game-based learning program at a university in Thailand. We conducted six interviews with each of them (for a total of 30 interviews) to identify what impact gameplay had in particular on their willingness to communicate in English (MacIntyre, Dornyei, Clement & Noels, 1998). The results showed that gameplay had a number of benefits for the participants in this study, in particular in terms of lowering their affective barriers to learning and increasing their willingness to communicate. We discuss the implications of these results in terms of further research and classroom practice.","Inclusion:

An Efficient Spectral Element Model with Electric DOFs for the Static and Dynamic Analysis of a Piezoelectric Bimorph,"Dong, Xingjian; Peng, Zhike; Zhang, Wenming; Hua, HongXing; Meng, Guang","An efficient spectral element (SE) model for static and dynamic analysis of a piezoelectric bimorph is proposed. It combines an equivalent single layer (ESL) model for the mechanical displacement field with a sublayer approximation for the electric potential. The 2D Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) shape functions are used to discretize the displacements and then the governing equation of motion is derived following the standard SE method procedure. It is shown numerically that the present SE model can well predict both the global and local responses such as mechanical displacements, natural frequencies, and the electric potentials across the bimorph thickness. In the case of bimorph sensor application, it is revealed that the distribution of the induced electric potential across the thickness does not affect the global natural frequencies much. Furthermore, the effects of the order of Legendre polynomial and the mesh size on the convergence rate are investigated. Comparison of the present results for a bimorph sensor with those from 3D finite element (FE) simulations establishes that the present SE model is accurate, robust, and computationally efficient.","Inclusion:

An Investigation of Game-Embedded Handheld Devices to Enhance English Learning,"Hung, Hui-Chun; Young, Shelley Shwu-Ching","This study proposed and implemented a system combining the advantages of both educational games and wireless handheld technology to promote the interactive English learning in the classroom setting. An interactive English vocabulary acquisition board game was designed with the system being implemented on handheld devices. Thirty sixth-grade elementary students in Northern Taiwan were assigned to the experimental group and the control group and played the game with or without handheld devices. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from surveys, interviews, and observations. The results revealed that game-embedded handheld devices could increase the interdependence of the group and lead the learners into better immersion and interactions. We further proposed the cross-device-mediated interaction in the game-embedded face-to-face mobile computer-supported collaborative learning model that could be considered as one of the new literacies in the participatory culture. Six essential elements to develop a successful interactive game-embedded environment were identified from the interplay among the face-to-face environment, handheld devices, and educational game.","Inclusion:

Applying HOPSCOTCH as an exer-learning game in English lessons: two exploratory studies,"Lucht, Martina; Heidig, Steffi","This article describes HOPSCOTCH, a design concept for an exer-learning game to engage elementary school children in learning. Exer-learning is a new genre of digital learning games that combines playing and learning with physical activity (exercise). HOPSCOTCH is a first design concept for exer-learning games that can be applied to support the acquisition of factual knowledge. HOPSCOTCH is based on the popular playground game in which a course is drawn on the pavement with numbers that indicate the course to be hopped. In two exploratory studies at a German elementary school, we investigated the potential of HOPSCOTCH to engage students, as well as to facilitate the acquisition of factual knowledge (English vocabulary) and to improve the attitudes of students towards learning English as a second language. The results of these studies indicated that the students remembered and correctly spelled about the same number of new vocabulary words after learning with HOPSCOTCH as they did after a teacher-centred lesson. Importantly however, the students enjoyed playing this exer-learning game very much and they reported better attitudes towards studying English after learning vocabulary with HOPSCOTCH compared to a teacher-centred lesson. These encouraging first results support the assumption that HOPSCOTCH as a design concept may have the potential to actively engage players in learning activities leading to a virtuous circle of reduced low level disruption and self-exclusion, increased assimilation of knowledge and greater engagement in lessons to the benefit of the whole class, not just the better-motivated individual. As such we suggest that exer-learning games could serve as additional classroom control and teaching aids in schools.","Inclusion:

Applying the Flipped Classroom with Game-Based Learning in Elementary School Students' English Learning,"Tao S.-Y., Huang Y.-H., Tsai M.-J.","Game-based learning can not only lead to learning through the virtual game world but also trigger learner motives via planned gaming processes. Supplemented game-based learning activities not only allow learners to practice repeatedly but also entail them to reach learning objectives. This study aimed to utilize flipped classroom with digital game-based learning activities in elementary school students' English learning. The study investigated the effects of English learning, and the motivation of the experimental group in attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction. Results indicate that there were no significant differences between the experimental and control groups. However, the experimental group did show large improvement in learning achievements after game-based flipped learning activities. By looking at the conscious reaction of experimental group toward the flipped classroom with game-based learning, in addition, the research found that participants believed the method could trigger their interest and curiosity in learning, and that the games prepared them for successive learning materials. Moreover, results also show that the game-based learning process could promote their sense of accomplishment in learning, thus encouraging them to continue learning. © 2016 IEEE.","Inclusion:

Between learning and playing? Exploring learners' perceptions of corrective feedback in an immersive game for English pragmatics,"Cornillie, Frederik; Clarebout, Geraldine; Desmet, Piet","This paper aims to provide a rationale for the utility of corrective feedback (CF) in digital games designed for language learning, with specific reference to learners' perceptions. Explicit and elaborate CF has the potential to increase learners' understanding of language, but might not be found useful in a game-based learning environment where the primary focus for the learner is on meaningful interaction and experiential learning. Also, as CF can be perceived as a measure of performance, it could harm learners' perception of competence. Eighty-three learners of English as a foreign language participated in a mixed-method experimental study that aimed to first explore the perceived usefulness of, and preferences for, explicit and implicit CF in an immersive educational game, and to secondly chart the relation between learners' perceptions of CF as they pertain to three individual difference factors related to learners' self-perception, namely intrinsic goal orientation, perceived competence and game experience. Survey and interview data showed that CF was found to be generally useful. A regression model indicated that the three measures of self-perception affected learners' perceptions of explicit CF positively, and that there was no impact on perceptions of implicit CF. Further, learners reported having enjoyed the implicit CF, although they did not find it particularly useful for learning. These findings indicate that the type of CF should be considered in the design of effective and enjoyable educational games.","Inclusion:

Clickers in the flipped classroom: bring your own device (BYOD) to promote student learning,"Hung, Hsiu-Ting","Flipped classrooms continue to grow in popularity across all levels of education. Following this pedagogical trend, the present study aimed to enhance the face-to-face instruction in flipped classrooms with the use of clickers. A game-like clicker application was implemented through a bring your own device (BYOD) model to gamify classroom dynamics in the spirit of question-and-answer competitions. A series of flipped learning lessons were created for the study, with clickers integrated into question-and-answer activities associated with each of the lessons as formative assessments to assist students in the learning of English as a foreign language. In this quasi-experimental research, the data were gathered using a summative assessment, a perception survey, and individual interviews. The collected data were then analyzed to compare the students' flipped learning experiences, with or without clicker use. The results indicated that the gamified use of clickers had positive influences on student learning, with regard to their performance, perceptions, and preferences. This study thus suggests that the emerging generation of clicker technology allows for a cost-effective BYOD integration model in flipped classrooms, through which it is possible to seamlessly bridge pre-class and in-class activities and to effectively promote student learning.","Inclusion:

Comparative Effectiveness Between Game-Enhanced and Pencil-and-Paper English Vocabulary Learning Approaches,Yu Zhonggen,"Numerous studies were devoted to use of games in vocabulary learning in English as a foreign language (EFL) tertiary courses, which reported significant improvements of vocabulary learning when using computer games. This study used a mixed-design research method comparing the effectiveness in EFL vocabulary acquisition. Data was collected from randomly selected participants who were randomly assigned to the interactivity-prone computer game (Group 1), the less interactive-prone computer game (Group 2) and the pencil-and-paper (Group 3) assisted EFL vocabulary learning approaches. The first group learned EFL vocabulary through interactivity-prone computer game Hujiang Fun Vocabulary, the second group learned EFL vocabulary assisted with less interactive computer game Baicizhan, and the third group learned EFL vocabulary via the traditional pencil-and-paper approach. It was concluded that (1) The interactivity-prone computer game was more effective than the less interactivity-prone computer game in EFL vocabulary learning; (2) The computer game-assisted EFL vocabulary learning was significantly more effective than the traditional pencil-and-paper approach; (3) Males outperformed females in computer game-assisted EFL vocabulary learning. It was suggested that future research focuses on both design features of educational computer games and cross-disciplinary research into computer game assisted EFL vocabulary acquisition.",,404,2018,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GAMING AND COMPUTER-MEDIATED SIMULATIONS,10,2,WOS
Comparing Digital Badges-and-Points with Classroom Token Systems: Effects on Elementary School ESL Students' Classroom Behavior and English Learning,"Homer, Ryan; Hew, Khe Foon; Tan, Cheng Yong","This paper reports the findings of a field experiment that gamified the classroom experience of elementary school ESL students by implementing digital badges-and-points which students could earn by achieving specific behavioral and learning goals. Altogether, 120 children in eight different classes participated in this study. Four of the classes (experimental group) used the digital badges-and-points available in ClassDojo, a free online classroom management system, while the other four classes (control group) employed a non-digital conventional school token point system. The results showed that digital badges-and-points afforded by ClassDojo significantly improved student learning in two classes (Grades 3 and 4) but not in Grades 1 and 2 classes. Overall, students reported enjoying using digital badges-and-points in the classrooms. Teacher observational data indicated that the digital badges-and-points group displayed more positive and on-task behaviors than the non-digital classroom token point system group.","Inclusion:

"Creating a BYOD Tour Around Poznan, Poland A Location-based Project for Teenage Students","Brzezinska, Magdalena","This paper focuses on a project that encompasses place-based learning, location-based learning and problem-based learning in teaching of English as a foreign language. It shows how a project of this type can increase student motivation and help teenagers embrace local culture. It originated when the author of this paper was introduced to the Wandering platform and the Experiencity platform by one of the co-creators of the former, Ms. Talila Yehiel, a museum expert and a designer of tailor-made sites for museum visits. After examining the various options of the Experiencity platform on her own, and upon developing two walks: The Past and the Present: Jewish Heritage Walk in Bielsko-Biala and Karl Korn Walk, the author undertook to test it with her teenage students, designing a completely new location-based activity: Be Active and Explore Poznan. As recommended by Piaget, the author challenged her students and was a guide and facilitator rather than a lecturer. She made the students work together and find answers and solutions to the problems posed. She also trusted Vygotsky and Dewey in assuming that learners are social individuals and place-based education helps ""students connect with their particular corners of the world"" (Woodhouse and Knapp, [9]). The walk demonstrates interaction of teenagers with and in space: it inspects the particular characteristics of a place, it is cross-curricular and intrinsically empirical, and it forms a relation between place, self and community (Woodhouse and Knapp, [9]). It also uses local environment to make students active citizens, contributing to the society (compare [7], p.7).","Inclusion:

Design and Assessment of Adaptive Hypermedia Games for English Acquisition in Preschool,"Enrique Agudo, J.; Rico, Mercedes; Sanchez, Hector","The increasing popularity of hypermedia games is reaching far beyond the boundaries of entertainment and edging its way into many educational domains. The growth in game technologies has created new teaching environments through proposals combining learning with fun and motivating expectations which make the use of digital games a relevant trend in versatile learning situations at all educational levels. Based on the implementation of the Shaiex project, funded by the government of Extremadura (Spain) and develop by the research group GexCALL, the aim of this paper is twofold. First, it analyses the steps and requirements for the design of adaptive games for the teaching of English as a foreign language at the preschool level. Exploring the general premises for task adaptation by personalizing content to children's needs and abilities, the implementation of the whole design is described in light of its applicability. Second, an assessment of the adaptive games designed is conducted, based on the assumption that selecting developmentally appropriate digital experiences to meet users' expectations and to maximize their learning potential should undergo careful evaluation.","Inclusion:

Design and evaluation of a physical interactive learning environment for english learning,"Yang J.C., Lin Y.L., Wu J.J., Chien K.H.","Recently, many researchers believe that learning motivation and interest can be enhanced by participating in educational games. Video capture virtual reality technologies provide a possibility for designing games. However, it has not been widely used in the field of educational games. A digital game-based learning system, called PILE (Physical Interactive Learning Environment), was developed which utilized video capture virtual reality technologies and was applied in educational setting with learning activity design. The learning activity was designed by integrating the PILE system to English learning materials of the third grade of elementary school along with the Phonics in a digital game-based learning design. An experiment of using the PILE system was conducted for examining English learning achievement, motivation and attitude with two groups. The experimental group used the PILE system for English learning. In contrast, the control group used PowerPoint slides for English learning. The result of the experiment shows that students' English achievement is enhanced by integrating the PILE system into English learning activity with game-based learning design.

"Design and Implementation of Location-Based Learning Games: Four Case Studies with ""QuesTInSitu: The Game""","Melero, Javier; Hernandez-Leo, Davinia","Over the past few years the use of educational games for learning purposes has reported many educational benefits in terms of students' motivation and engagement towards learning. One of the challenges in the research field of Game-Based Learning (GBL) is to create or adapt educational games to teachers' requirements depending on their particular situations. An approach to face this problem is to provide teachers with strategies that allow them to design meaningful games for their learning scenarios. To address this issue, a metaphor has been proposed for supporting teachers in the design of the so-called location-based learning games. In this study, we describe four real learning contexts, including 16 secondary education teachers use the proposed metaphor to design their own location-based games. Besides, in order to gain meaningful insights about the impact of the designed games in students' satisfaction, we deployed the teachers' designs in ""QuesTInSitu: The Game"". A total of 253 students from the 4 secondary schools played the designed games. The main findings derived from the evaluation with teachers and students provide meaningful insights about main considerations when designing and deploying location-based learning games for outdoors and indoors.","Inclusion:

Designing E-Learning games for rural children in India: A format for balancinq learning with fun,"Kam M., Agarwal A., Kumar A., Lal S., Mathur A., Tewari A., Canny J.","Poor literacy remains a barrier to economic empowerment in the developing world. Of particular importance is fluency in a widely spoken ""world language"" such as English, which is typically a second language for these low-income learners. We make the case that mobile games on cellphones is an appropriate solution in the typical ecologies of developing regions. The challenge is to design e-learning games that are both educational and pleasurable for our target learners, who have limited familiarity with high technology. We propose the receptive-practice-activation cycle that could be used as the conceptual model for the designs. We then report how this format could be refined, based on our experiences in the field with three games that have collectively undergone nine rounds of iterations. In particular, it appears that maintaining a distinction between learning and fun to some extent is necessary for effective designs. Copyright 2008 ACM.","Inclusion:

Designing location-based gaming applications with teenagers to address early school leaving,"Bates M., Saridaki M., Kolovou E., Mourlas C., Brown D., Burton A., Battersby S., Parsonage S., Yarnall T.","Early school leaving (ESL) is an urgent and serious problem, both for individuals and society as a whole. Factors such as learning difficulties, social problems or a lack of motivation, guidance or support all contribute to ESL, although the situation varies across EU countries. High rates of ESL are detrimental to making lifelong learning a reality and increase the risk of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. Since normally there is not a unique reason for leaving education or vocational training, answers are no easy. In response to these concerns, the Code RED project (http://www.coderedproject. eu) has been created to address the high proportion of drop out from Initial Vocational Education and Training (IVET) and ESL in the UK, Greece, Italy and Cyprus via the development of new games-based learning applications (both desktop and mobile) to inform young adults (aged 16+) of the issues surrounding ESL. Location-based gaming (LBG) applications represent a form of play that is designed to be undertaken on a device in motion which changes the game experience based on the location. The design of these products presents many challenges to developers surrounding user interfaces, processing power and the availability of space. The ARIS platform (Augmented Reality and Interactive Storytelling) covers a broad field of LBG design components such as geo-location data, location-sensitive informational objects, interactive dialogues and QR code input. As such, ARIS has been selected by Code RED researchers to teach LBG and mobile augmented reality design concepts and prototype new design ideas with young adults. This paper will discuss the issues which are contributing to ESL within the EU and report upon the results of a short term participatory design initiative within Code RED to co-design new location-based gaming applications with participating IVET students (aged 14+) to address these issues. In the UK, participating students were successful in formulating a game concept suitable for transfer into LBG surrounding lifestyle choices such as alcohol and drug abuse which may contribute to ESL. In Greece, participating students with learning disabilities were successful in creating a fictional 'solve the mystery' LBG using the ARIS platform. Students decided to focus the game's narrative on the issue of exclusion from school and jumping into fast conclusions during schooling years. In Italy, participating children were successful in designing an orienteering-based LBG to promote cultural heritage via exploration of an ancient castle. This process also enabled participants to research and learn more about this local landmark. The paper will discuss the application of the participatory design methodology between project partners and will document the LBG output from this process. Finally, the paper will identify how these products will be positioned as part of future work to address ESL.","Inclusion:

Designing location-based learning experiences for people with intellectual disabilities and additional sensory impairments,"Brown, David J.; McHugh, David; Standen, Penny; Evett, Lindsay; Shopland, Nick; Battersby, Steven","The research reported here is part of a larger project which seeks to combine serious games (or games-based learning) with location-based services to help people with intellectual disabilities and additional sensory impairments to develop work based skills. Specifically this paper reports on where these approaches are combined to scaffold the learning of new routes and ultimately independent travel to new work and educational opportunities. A phased development methodology is applied in a user sensitive manner, to ensure that user feedback drives the ongoing development process. Methods to structure this include group feedback on conceptual storyboards, expert review of prototypes using usability heuristics relating to the main system goals, and finally co-discovery methods with student pairs exploring all three modes of the system in real world contexts. Aspects of developmental and cognitive psychological theories are also reviewed and it is suggested that combining games-based learning approaches with location-based services is an appropriate combination of technologies for an application specifically designed to scaffold route learning for this target audience.

Designing serious games for computer assisted language learning - teacher/learner perspectives and user-centered design,"Meyer B., Sørensen B.H.","In this paper we shall discuss the potential of educational games (Serious Games) for teaching and learning English online focusing on user engagement, performance and design. The focus of the paper will be on how the designed space of a platform for learning English in primary school (www.mingoville.com) produces teacher and learner participation and involvement in the context of a formal learning environment. How do teachers and learners respond to the educational design of the platform in question and how do they perform language learning through the game-based design of the platform? The paper will build on data from a research project, Serious Games on a Global Market Place (2007-2010) in which the Mingoville.com platform has been studied in the context of English as a foreign language in Danish primary schools. The initial research process - which was based on an analysis of the platform as well as interviews with developers - suggested that one of the challenges of developing a design for serious games in language education consists of renegotiating the educational games genre to balance drill-based exercises with contextualised simulations that involve fruitful thinking, real language interaction and learner engagement. The second phase of the research process (piloted in the spring of 2008) involved observations of user responses to the platform in schools as well as interviews with teachers and children. On the basis of the initial results from the pilot project we are proposing that performance and engagement through Serious Games for language learning should be understood in the context of gaming and learning as both separate and interconnected processes in which the teacher has a central role as mediator.",,404,2008,Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-based Learning,2008-January,,Scopus
Development and evaluation of peer feedback in the English quiz game design in social network,"Hwang J.-P., Wu T.-T., Huang Y.-M., Huang Y.-M.","In this study, we developed a game-based learning system on a social network platform to instruct customs and cultures in the English speaking countries in order to investigate the increase of learning willingness and motivation by using the digital game-based learning(DBGL) model. To determine the learning behaviors and results of the learning design which combines game-based and social network theories, this study involved students from an elementary school to implement a multi-player, real-time quiz game, known as 'Challenger', on the Facebook platform. As players, the learners can ""Call Out"" for help or assistance; however, online friends hold the decision of ""Replying"" or ""Not to Reply"" the players' ""Call Outs"". This mechanism is so called ""Peer Feedback"". Results of this study showed that the DGBL incorporated into a social network website is a feasible and sound model for teaching. By the model, English learning will become more interesting which makes students more enjoyable in learning auxiliary materials after school if they cannot fully comprehend the course in the classroom. By the outcome, we found peer influence seems not only motivates learner's participation in the game but also catalyze learning effectiveness. © 2012 IEEE.","Inclusion:

Data were collected from randomly selected participants, who were randomly assigned to three cohorts in both experiments: (1) Cohort A, where they learned English vocabulary through the more interactivity-prone serious games-Hujiang Fun Vocabulary in the first experiment and New Oriental Fun Vocabulary in the second experiment; (2) Cohort B, where they learned English vocabulary aided with the less interactivity-prone serious games-Baicizhan in the first experiment and Kingsoft Vocabulary in the second experiment; (3) Cohort C, where they learned English vocabulary through traditional approaches in both experiments. It is concluded that (1) the interactivity-prone serious gaming is significantly more effective than the less interactivity-prone serious gaming in English vocabulary learning at the significance level p = .05; (2) the less interactivity-prone serious gaming is significantly more effective than the traditional approach in English vocabulary learning at the significance level p = .05; (3) males significantly outperformed females in serious game-aided English vocabulary learning at the significance level p = .05. We also discussed the features that should be considered when a serious game is designed to assist English vocabulary learning.

Educational design of serious games - In the research field of computer-assisted language learning,"Meyer B., Sørensen B.H.","In this paper we shall discuss the potential of serious games for teaching and learning languages online. As suggested by for instance Warschauer (2004) computer-assisted language learning (CALL) may have a profound influence on the ways in which languages are learned and taught, as CALL may support the need of language learners to use languages in meaningful contexts to have a real impact on the world. The issue for language education may therefore be to explore the potential of online games for simulated or real interaction that includes learners' own production of language in protected settings. The paper will build on data from a research project, Serious Games on a Global Market Place (2007- 2010), funded by the Danish Council for Strategic Research, in which an online game-based platform for teaching and learning English (www.Mingoville.com) has been studied in the context of English as a second language in Danish primary schools.

One hypothesis of the project is, following the initial research and drawing on previous research in the field, that the process of designing serious games for CALL may significantly benefit from involving children's own experiences with using languages (primarily English) online for gaming and interacting. The paper will suggest ways of incorporating these experiences into the educational design of game-based material for CALL.",,404,2008,"Computer Games and Allied Technology 08, CGAT 08 - Animation, Multimedia, IPTV and Edutainment, Proceedings",,,Scopus
Effects of anxiety levels on learning performance and gaming performance in digital game-based learning,"Yang, J. C.; Lin, M. Y. D.; Chen, S. Y.","Anxiety plays an influential role in foreign language learning. However, a lack of attention was paid to examining the effects of anxiety levels on learning performance and gaming performance in digital game-based learning. To this end, this study developed a game-based English learning system and investigated how different levels of anxiety affected learners' learning performance and gaming performance. A quasi-experiment was conducted in an elementary school. The results showed that high-anxiety learners performed worse than low-anxiety learners in speaking, word/sentence match, and overall learning performance. However, they performed similarly in listening performance. Moreover, the results showed that high- and low-anxiety learners demonstrated a similar level of gaming performance. A subsequent analysis showed that significant correlations existed between learning performance and gaming performance for learners with high anxiety whereas such positive correlations were rarely found for learners with low anxiety, indicating that high-anxiety learners' learning performance could be fostered by their gaming performance. The findings suggested that digital game-based learning was particularly beneficial to high-anxiety learners, whose gaming performance was a facilitative factor of their learning performance.","Inclusion:

"Effects of Design Factors of Game-Based English Vocabulary Learning APP on Learning Performance, Sustained Attention, Emotional State, and Memory Retention","Hsu C.-F., Chen C.-M., Cao D.","Numerous studies have confirmed that increasing vocabulary size is a critical part of learning English as a foreign language (EFL). In recent years, game-based learning has been identified as a promising means of acquiring and retaining knowledge. The rapid development of mobile technologies has forced instructors to consider the potential of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL). As a result, this work assesses the effects of two different game-based English vocabulary learning apps with significantly different game design factors on learners performance, sustained attention, relaxation, and vocabulary retention. A total of 36 Grade 12 students from Matsu Senior High School, Taiwan, who participated in this study were randomly divided into two experimental groups, which were balanced for the distribution of gender and pretest scores. The learners in the two experimental groups learned English vocabulary for four weeks using two game-based English vocabulary learning apps with significantly different game design factors. Analytical results reveal that learners who used games with weak game design factors exhibited significantly better vocabulary learning performance, retention, and relaxation than those who used games with strong game design factors, and their level of sustained attention was lower. This work verifies that gender differences existed between the two game-based English vocabulary learning apps with different game design factors. Girls achieved significantly better English vocabulary learning and retention in the game APP with weak game design factors. Additionally, based on an interview with several research participants, matching of the challenge to player skill and feedback were the most important game design factors in game-based English vocabulary learning apps. In summary, a more exciting game does not favor cognitive learning, including English vocabulary learning. © 2017 IEEE.","Inclusion:

Effects of mobile game-based English vocabulary learning app on learners' perceptions and learning performance: A case study of Taiwanese EFL learners,"Yen L., Chen C.-M., Huang H.-B.","Many previous studies confirmed that vocabulary size plays a key role in the learning processes of English as a foreign language (EFL), and the repetition strategy is still the most widely-used strategy for vocabulary learning. However, it has long been argued that the repetition strategy may make learners passive, or even indifferent, to their vocabulary learning. With the rapid development of information and communication technology (ICT), mobile game-based learning (MGBL) has been considered as a promising scheme for assisting learners in successfully acquiring and retaining knowledge. Thus, this study assesses the effects of utilizing PHONE Words, which is a novel mobile English vocabulary learning APP designed with game-related functions (MEVLA-GF) and without game-related functions (MEVLA-NGF), as a learning tool on learners' perceptions and learning performance. During the four-week experimental treatment, twenty sophomore students from the College of Liberal Arts of National Chengchi University were recruited as the research subjects and were randomly and averagely assigned into the experimental group using MEVLA-GF and the control group using MEVLA-NGF for vocabulary learning. Analytical results show that the learning performance of vocabulary acquisition and vocabulary retention in the experimental group were both significantly higher than those of control group. Moreover, results of the questionnaire survey confirm that MEVLA-GF generates higher effectiveness and satisfaction of facilitating English vocabulary learning than MEVLA-NGF does. Results of Pearson correlation analysis show that learners' involvements and dependence on gamified functions of MEVLA-GF were positively correlated with their vocabulary learning performance.",,404,2016,"Proceedings of the International Conference on e-Learning, ICEL",2016-January,,Scopus
Effects of prior knowledge on cognitive learning outcomes within an english learning multiplayer online role-playing game,"Yang J.C., Hsu H.F.","This study developed an English learning online role-playing game targeting knowledge of vocabulary and sentence patterns, and conducted an experimental study of 55 aged 12 sixth-grade students using this game to investigate how the learner characteristic, in terms of prior English ability, influences cognitive learning outcomes. Although there have been studies examining the effectiveness of online games on cognitive learning outcomes in education, there is still little consensus on the learning effectiveness of game-based learning. Factors such as learner characteristics should be taken into consideration while designing educational games since individual differences may affect willingness of learners to better performance within a game-based learning environment. By analyzing the data collected from achievement tests, it was found in this study that students' prior knowledge could be a key factor that collectively influences the effectiveness of knowledge acquisition in game-based learning. The results of this study may help educators consider how effectively utilizing an MMORPG-based educational game for enhancing students' learning effectiveness in game-based learning. © 2013 IEEE.","Inclusion:

Effects of Prior Knowledge on Learning Performance and Anxiety in an English Learning Online Role-Playing Game,"Yang, Jie Chi; Quadir, Benazir","The great value of applying digital games in language learning has been highlighted. However, there has been a lack of attention paid to the effects of prior knowledge in a contextual game-based language learning environment. To this end, this study developed an MMORPG-based educational game to facilitate English learning, aiming at investigating how students' different levels of prior knowledge, in terms of their prior English ability and online gaming experience, affect their learning performance and anxiety. The results showed that the high English ability students significantly outperformed those with low English ability, the low online gaming experience students significantly outperformed those with high online gaming experience, and the low English ability students experienced significantly higher degrees of anxiety than those with high English ability. Furthermore, the results showed that prior English ability was positively correlated to learning performance but negatively correlated to anxiety, and anxiety was negatively correlated to learning performance. These findings suggest that a contextual game-based learning environment can be exploited as a useful tool to support language learning; however, the learning performance and anxiety created by the environment were affected to varying degrees by the levels of students' prior knowledge.","""Inclusion:

Effects of the Badge Mechanism on Self-Efficacy and Learning Performance in a Game-Based English Learning Environment,"Yang J.C., Quadir B., Chen N.-S.","A growing number of studies have been conducted on digital game-based learning (DGBL). However, there has been a lack of attention paid to individuals' self-efficacy and learning performance in the implementation of DGBL. This study therefore investigated how the badge mechanism in DGBL enhanced users' self-efficacy in the subject domain of English as a foreign language. In the study, a digital game-based English learning environment was designed with a badge mechanism including digital badges, leaderboard ranking, and learning practice with star icons. A quasi-experimental design was implemented. A total of 50 third-grade elementary school students participated in this study. Hypotheses were tested, and data were analyzed using paired sample t tests, multiple regression analyses, linear regression analyses, and logistic regression analyses. The results show that the badge mechanism had a significant positive influence on the learners' self-efficacy and English learning performance. The study also investigated how self-efficacy could affect English learning performance, with the results revealing that it had a significant positive influence on learning performance. In addition, a subsequent analysis showed that those students with higher self-efficacy performed better than those with lower self-efficacy. © 2016 The Author(s).","Inclusion:

EFL learning media for early childhood through speech recognition application,"Satria F., Aditra H., Wibowo M.D.A., Luthfiansyah H., Suryani M., Paulus E., Suryana I.","In Indonesia, English language use as a foreign language (EFL) and become one of the major subject since elementary school till the university. Sometimes it's hard to teach English language only by speech, especially to the young learner. Based on it, game-based learning combined with speech recognition has been developed. The proposed game helps and facilitates the children to learn English and introducing children to various animal themes. The game is packed in a fun and interesting concept in a form of an interactive game so that learning process could be more effective and not only to help them learn faster but also entertaining them in the process. This game is operated by using speech recognition and use Kinect as its main platform to interact with. This was chosen as the main way to interact with the application so that children can not only play the game but also improve their English pronunciation and vocabulary. The game also tested to the 30 respondents to know the usability of the system and the motivation to learn. Based on the experiments, the results showed that all respondents agreed that the proposed game has a good usability. It can be seen from the average of central tendency value that reaches about 4.38. Based on the results, we concluded that the proposed game-based learning gave new experiences, easy to use, and became fun alternative for young learners to study the EFL. © 2017 IEEE.","Inclusion:

ENHANCING ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS' MOTIVATION THROUGH ONLINE GAMES,"Iaremenko, Nataliia V.","In this article, we examine the potentials of online games which teachers can employ in order to motivate their students and summarize the positive effects of playing learning games. The study addresses the question of how gamified learning is applicable to learning English as a second language. The other research questions refer to the reasons that make language learners want to play a learning game and the influence of particular game elements onto players. All of these questions are investigated on the example of Kahoot web resource. The study suggests that online learning games can foster intrinsic motivation and help engage students in learning activities. The use of online games in English as a second language learning shows the direct relationship between a high energy level of fun competition and increased motivation.","Inclusion:

Evaluating listening and speaking skills in a mobile game-based learning environment with situational contexts,"Hwang, Wu-Yuin; Shih, Timothy K.; Ma, Zhao-Heng; Shadiev, Rustam; Chen, Shu-Yu","Game-based learning activities that facilitate students' listening and speaking skills were designed in this study. To participate in learning activities, students in the control group used traditional methods, while students in the experimental group used a mobile system. In our study, we looked into the feasibility of mobile game-based learning activities. One experiment was carried out and the results revealed that the experimental-group students significantly outperformed the control-group students on the verbal post-test. However, the performance of the two groups was equal on the listening post-test. Two variables (the average score for the interactive jigsaw game and the number of designed cards) were found to be the most important factors for influencing students' performance in the verbal post-test. Furthermore, most students had positive perceptions toward learning activities that are supported by a mobile system. These results suggest that game-based learning activities can significantly improve students' speaking skills if driven by a mobile system. Furthermore, these results suggest that learning activities with a mobile system foster students to (1) practice speaking English as a foreign language (EFL) more frequently as well as to reflect on their speech; (2) create meaningful sentences and speak with greater accuracy and confidence; and (3) practice speaking EFL in an authentic context.","Inclusion:

Examining a Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game as a Digital Game-Based Learning Platform,"Wu M.L., Richards K., Saw G.K.","A concurrent triangulation mixed-method research design was used to investigate 19 casual gamers' or non-gamers' use of a popular massive multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), Everquest 2, as an alternative pedagogical tool to support communicative use of the English language. This study poses that MMORPGs could serve as a virtually rich context for social interactions to aid development of communicative competence. Data were collected from semi-structured interviews, surveys, and through gameplay observations in Taiwan and the United States. Analysis of interview recordings, survey data, and observational data focuses on how player-generated perceptions align with Yee's (2006) motivation components and Ryan and Deci's (2000) theoretical assumptions of self-determination theory. Results from quantitative data analysis showed that both male and female participants in this study prioritized the importance of relatedness in playing Everquest 2 to practice using English for communicative purposes. Qualitative data analysis likewise revealed the importance of communication during gameplay. Integrated findings showed that player perceptions could be helpful in illuminating the potential of utilizing MMORPGs for game-assisted language learning and also inform different motivations in gaming to learn. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Inclusion:

Exploring digital nativeness as a predictor of digital game-based L2 vocabulary acquisition,Calvo-Ferrer J.R.,"Although the “digital natives” theory is still used to justify the implementation of technologies such as video games in the language classroom, whether digital nativeness (i.e. the extent to which an individual embodies the characteristics attributed to digital natives) may be used as a predictor of digital game-based learning outcomes is to be analysed. An empirical study was conducted to test the predictive strength of some attributes of digital nativeness, as determined by Teo’s (2013) Digital Native Assessment Scale, on L2 vocabulary acquisition and on educational engagement. A vocabulary learning game was played by 86 university EFL students, who additionally completed post- and delayed knowledge tests on the vocabulary contained in the game, the DNAS questionnaire, and questions on educational disengagement and perceived need for technology-related changes. The regression analysis revealed that the factor “able to multitask” was a predictor of poorer L2 vocabulary acquisition, whereas the factors “comfortable with technology” and “thrive on instant gratifications and rewards” had a positive impact on learning outcomes. Additionally, the analysis showed that none of the attributes of digital natives that make up the DNAS could predict either students’ disengagement with the educational system or their perceived need for technology-based changes in education. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Inclusion:

Fostering autonomous learners of vocabulary acquisition using content-based ICT methods,"Matsubara M., Yoshida H.","Purpose: This paper investigated that (1) the effective use of content-based ICT methods of vocabulary acquisition through reading activities, and (2) the encouragement of learner's vocabulary building up autonomous learning. A considerable number of studies have been conducted on vocabulary acquisition in the EFL field in Japan, and researchers advocate vocabulary knowledge is the most important factor contributing to reading comprehension, yet, a firm effective pedagogy has not been established. In fact, university students encounter difficulties in reading comprehension because of their deficiencies in vocabulary knowledge during English reading class. Methodology: The free applications, Quizlet and Kahoot!, were adopted to incorporate language-focused learning while adding some gamification aspects to aid in vocabulary acquisition. The experiment was conducted in a Japanese undergraduate first-year reading class over an 11-week period. Quizlet was used for vocabulary learning prior to the reading class. Students were given multiple-choice vocabulary Cloze tests of new words from the textbook using Kahoot!, a free game-based educational platform. Main Findings: The results of this study indicated that content-based vocabulary instruction using ICT is effective and improves learner’s academic performance in vocabulary acquisition. Moreover, questionnaires were thoroughly reviewed and uncovered that students felt they developed more autonomy and this enhanced their motivation for vocabulary learning. Implications: In view of this study, ICT methods closely related to reading contexts and a variety of applications for vocabulary acquisition and improvement of reading performance should be introduced in EFL classrooms. © 2018, Gyandhara International Academic Publications.

From orlando to Russia: Cross-cultural communication through gamemaking,"Kourova A., Salter A., Pidberejna I., McDaniel R.","While physical study abroad and exchange programs are proven methods for building cross-cultural communication, there are many limitations on the number of people who get to participate and how accessible such programs are to diverse populations. To address such inequities of access and consider virtual alternatives and supplements to traditional study abroad programs, a team of faculty and students collaborated on making a game designed to facilitate both English-language learning and cross-cultural communication through providing a virtual version of a trip to the United States. This paper discusses the historical context enabling such a project to occur and then discusses the process of building and deploying a game designed by US students for a Russian audience of visually-impaired students at the Grot School in St. Petersburg, Russia. The resulting text- and audio-based game demonstrates the potential of situated user-centered game design as a pedagogical practice with learning outcomes both for the student creators and the audience of student players. The resulting game was requested by 11 other institutions. The results reported here highlight the ability of game based learning to facilitate cross cultural communication, develop mutual understandings, and build relationships between culturally diverse students on an interpersonal level. It further reveals how the use of open source game creating tools provide a customizable game platform for the development of ideas to improve intercultural competence in the context of language learning (such as EFL) when other resources are not readily available. The impact of this type of initiative is thus far greater than the created object (the game): it illustrates the strong potential of games and game-making as a method for advancing cultural discourse, an important prerequisite for effective intercultural communication and documentation. © 2016 ACM.","Inclusion:

Game-Based approaches for specializing in information technology,"Fahrutdinov R.R., Khakimzyanova D.F., Melnikova O.K., Shamsutdinova E.K.","The paper deals with game-based learning approaches to teaching English as a foreign language to students majoring in IT at Kazan Federal University, Russian Federation. As there appeared a lot of game-based teaching methods, the techniques called gamification as well as differences between them are reviewed because both of them are supposed to be similar in education of late. Another problem with games in education is that some scholars still do not differentiate properly between gamification and game-based learning. This misconception is reflected even in their recent scientific works where gamification sometimes is regarded as mere usage of games in learning process. According to researches, the impact of games on learning process is efficient in terms of developing vocabulary and speaking skills, improving foreign language acquisition, boosting motivation and engagement of students and creating opportunities to apply acquired knowledge in practice. Moreover, implementing games in class environment (depending on the type of the game used) enhances critical and logical thinking, problem solving, team work skills. Using various games in the learning process is particularly efficient for IT students, since it is related to their major. Another advantage of game-based learning is that it can be realized within the learning management system (LMS).

Gamification in location-based M-learning: Students' perceptions of game elements,"Honório J., Moura J.A.B., Brito P., Menezes T., Barros M.","Applications for Mobile-Learning, used in conjunction with strategies based on games, provide new opportunities for the learning process in the physical and virtual worlds. Although previous works evaluated location-based mobile applications (and its variations), most of them focused almost entirely on specific metrics, leaving the player's perspective aside. This paper presents study results for the evaluation of m- Learning applications from the students' perspective regarding the learning experience based on location and the game elements that might make the learning process more appealing to them. The study collected major game elements from the literature and applied questionnaires to 53 students from public high schools (junior high) in two states of Northeast Brazil. The results suggest that the majority of students have interest in this learning approach and consider most of the analysed game elements important to promote learning motivation, even though there are elements that are not as appealing. The paper contributes to the design of gamified location-based m-Learning applications in the sense that it provides insight into the importance of their requirements players perceive and may thus, serve as a guide for such applications versioning.

Gamification of System-on-Chip design,"Hamalainen T.D., Salminen E.","This paper presents drastic new concepts for SoC design tools. The motivation is ever increasing productivity gap that is caused by complexity of the design process with current methods. Plain code, schematic block diagrams and various graph-tree-table descriptions have been there for tens of years. Unfortunately, designers have problems in understanding the big picture of the design and quickly finding the interesting points. As an example, capturing register/memory definitions are simply getting impossible when different operation points of the system change them at runtime. We envision gamification as a new SoC design paradigm. It includes 3D visualization and semantic zoom to capture the design content, and gameplay for the design process. As the result, SoC design becomes engaging and users can easier focus on making the essential design decisions. A demo game is under construction and will be presented in forthcoming publications. © 2014 IEEE.","Inclusion:

Gender differences in flow state in an English learning environment achievement system,"Quadir B., Yang J.C., Chen Y.-H.","In recent years, a growing number of studies have been conducted on the individual differences in digital game-based learning (DGBL). Despite this growing interest, there is a lack of sound empirical evidence on individual differences (e.g., gender differences) in flow state in achievement systems in English learning environments. This study investigated whether any gender differences existed in such a system. To this end, the current study developed an achievement system including a reward mechanism-based design with learning features (i.e., interaction and rewards for correct answers) to facilitate English learning. An experiment was conducted. A total of 50 respondents participated in the study. Data were analyzed using independent sample t-tests. The results revealed that the female respondents had significantly higher mean scores for flow state than the males.","Inclusion:

Group-based mobile learning: Do group size and sharing mobile devices matter?,"Melero, Javier; Hernandez-Leo, Davinia; Manatunga, Kalpani","Within the field of Game-based Learning (GBL) location-based games are based on pervasive and mobile learning to allow the creation of in situ learning activities considering gamification mechanisms. In these learning activities collaboration often plays an important role. Usually, groups of students have to perform different tasks with single mobile device, This paper studies the effects of sharing a mobile device within groups and the size of groups in students' engagement and their activity performance in an indoor location-based learning activity. In particular, the paper focuses on a game designed by a secondary education teacher to support a learning activity in a contemporary art museum. The teacher's design has been implemented using ""QuesTInSitu: The Game"" technology. A total of 76 students played the game during a 3-h activity in the museum. The analysis of the data shows that while there are not important differences in the satisfaction with the activity of the students carrying and not carrying the mobile device within their groups, carrying the device does have a significant (positive) impact in their performance. Group size (4 vs. 5 members) does not seem to be a variable affecting individuals' performance but students in 4-member groups express higher levels of engagement. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

How are Serious Games used in the Classroom setting? - Based on the Learning Theory,"Hwang C.-I., Kim S.H.","Background/Objectives: The purpose of this study is to identify how serious games can be utilized for an educational purpose. Educational psychologists categorize learning theories into three subjects; behaviorism, cognitivism and constructivism. Methods/Statistical Analysis: This study was designed based on the methodology of Design-Based Research (DBR) and for analysis of research, coding technique of grounded theory was borrowed. To analyze the practical educational use of serious game, the researcher designed and applied high school English class that utilizes a serious game. Findings: In the aspect of behaviorism, advantages of serious game were discovered by seeing the fact that students were exposed to the environment where they could easily memorize through getting achievements and retaining memory with repetition. Such compensation was easily implemented due to a strengthening element that serious game itself has and students could be easily immersed through it. In the aspect of cognitivism, the possibility of a cross subject learning through designing game environment by teachers was discovered and the ease of learning could be utilized through taskbased learning. Also, teachers can make use of this method to connect students' prior knowledge and new information by presenting appropriate amount of work. On the other hand, in the aspect of constructivism, researchers developed a process of meeting students while maintaining anonymity to effectively observe student problem-solving in the game. Multi-dimensional interaction and resolving issues generated by difference of cultural literacy other than difference of language present not only an environment to students but also new task to teachers. Application/Improvements: The results are significant in the study of serious games that it presented the connection between a function of game and a learning type.","Inclusion:

How does ubiquitous game-based system influence students' learning motivation,Liu T.-Y.,"This study investigated how ubiquitous game-based system influence learning motivation for junior high school students. The English course was conducted on a campus by using a ubiquitous learning system called the Handheld English Language Learning Organization (HELLO). Two group students participated in the learning activities prescribed in a curriculum by separately using ubiquitous game-based learning and non-gaming learning. During the experiment, a survey, and interviews were conducted for the students. The evaluation results of the learning motivation demonstrated that incorporating ubiquitous games into the English learning process could achieve a better learning motivation than using non-gaming method.","Inclusion:

Identifying pedagogical uses of serious games for learning English as a second language,"Patiño A., Romero M.","Nowadays, English is a global language taught as a second language in most of non-English speaking countries. Over recent decades, Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) has evolved into solutions that allow a higher learner engagement in authentic active-based learning activities. In this context, the educational digital games, also known as Serious Games (SG), allow learning English as a Second Language (ESL) in a playful and engaging environment. In this study, we develop a literature review on the current uses of SG in the context of CALL, in general, and ESL, specifically, in order to create a taxonomy of pedagogical uses of SG for ESL. The taxonomy could be of utility for teachers aiming to integrate SG in their ESL courses. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Inclusion:

Improving literacy in rural India: Cellphone games in an after-school program,"Kam M., Kumar A., Jain S., Mathur A., Canny J.","Literacy is one of the great challenges in the developing world. But universal education is an unattainable dream for those children who lack access to quality educational resources such as well-prepared teachers and schools. Worse, many of them do not attend school regularly due to their need to work for the family in the agricultural fields or households. This work commitment puts formal education far out of their reach. On the other hand, educational games on cellphones hold the promise of making learning more accessible and enjoyable. In our project's 4th year, we reached a stage where we could implement a semester-long pilot on cellphone-based learning. The pilot study took the form of an after-school program in a village in India. This paper reports on this summative learning assessment. While we found learning benefits across the board, it seemed that more of the gains accrued to those children who were better equipped to take advantage of this opportunity. We conclude with future directions for designing educational games that target less well-prepared children in developing regions.","Inclusion:

Improving the effectiveness of English vocabulary review by integrating ARCS with mobile game-based learning,"Wu, Ting-Ting","Memorizing English vocabulary is often considered uninteresting, and a lack of motivation exists during learning activities. Moreover, most vocabulary practice systems automatically select words from articles and do not provide integrated model methods for students. Therefore, this study constructed a mobile game-based English vocabulary practice system, which imitates the popular block elimination game and combines test items of article, difficulty, and teacher model in accordance with curriculum objectives and demands. The participants were first-year students and classified into traditional group (Group T) and game-based group (Group G), and learning effectiveness and motivation were analysed in this study. According to statistical analysis results, students who used the game-based vocabulary practice system, which could captivate their attention and interest, had higher learning effectiveness and provided positive feedback of learning motivation. Furthermore, English teachers could select teaching materials that are consistent with the features, knowledge, and cultural background of learners to improve the relevance dimension of learning motivation.","Inclusion:

"Individual differences in an English learning achievement system: gaming flow experience, gender differences and learning motivation","Yang, Jie Chi; Quadir, Benazir","Despite the growing interest in digital game-based learning (DGBL), there has been a lack of attention paid to the effects of individual differences, such as gaming flow experience and gender differences, in a reward-based achievement system. To this end, this study developed an achievement system with a reward mechanism to facilitate English learning. This study investigated how individuals' gaming flow experience levels affected their levels of learning motivation, and whether any gender differences existed in gaming flow experience and learning motivation while engaging in the achievement system. The results showed that gaming flow experience significantly predicted learning motivation, whereby the students with high gaming flow experience were six times more likely to have high learning motivation than those with low gaming flow experience. Subsequent analysis showed that the female students had significantly higher gaming flow than the male students, but the male and female students showed similar learning motivation. Furthermore, the results indicated that the male students achieved more interactive rewards than the female students, but no significant differences were found in the male and female students' achievement of other types of rewards. Based on these findings, the authors contribute to the literature by developing a framework which can be applied to support designers to accommodate individual differences in DGBL.",Repeated: Gender differences in flow state in an English learning environment achievement system,INC,2018,TECHNOLOGY PEDAGOGY AND EDUCATION,27,3,WOS
Integrating video-capture virtual reality technology into a physically interactive learning environment for English learning,"Yang, Jie Chi; Chen, Chih Hung; Jeng, Ming Chang","The aim of this study is to design and develop a Physically Interactive Learning Environment, the PILE system, by integrating video-capture virtual reality technology into a classroom. The system is designed for elementary school level English classes where students can interact with the system through physical movements. The system is designed to be easily established with a minimal amount of equipments that includes a personal computer, a webcam, and a projector. The learning activities comprise six stages, holding specific tasks and learning objectives. Each stage is designed with a distinct device. These devices, including a conical cap, a pistol, a searchlight, a magnet, and a spray paint can, are designed to improve the accuracy of detection as well as to increase student enjoyment during the learning process. Furthermore, the system consists of five functional modules, such as providing an interface for teachers to incorporate appropriate learning materials according to their specific teaching requirements. An empirical study is conducted to examine the effects of the use of the PILE system by comparing two different types of English learning methods with 60 second-grade students from two classes at an elementary school in Taiwan. Four different tests are used to assess the different aspects of the system: an English learning achievement test, a questionnaire assessing students' learning motivation, a Short Feedback Questionnaire (SFQ), and a teacher interview. The results of students' English learning achievement tests show that there was a significant difference between the pretest and the posttest in the experimental group, as well as between the two groups in the delayed test. These results demonstrate that the system had a significantly beneficial effect on students' long-term learning. The results from the questionnaires on students' learning motivation and the SFQ reveal that the system enhanced the students' learning motivation. The results gained from the teacher's interview illustrate that the teacher believed this system was beneficial in assisting English learning. All findings collectively demonstrate that the proposed PILE system effectively assist English learning in a classroom environment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Inclusion:

Interaction of problem-based gaming and learning anxiety in language students' English listening performance and progressive behavioral patterns,"Hwang, Gwo-Jen; Hsu, Ting-Chia; Lai, Chiu-Lin; Hsueh, Ching-Jung","Scholars have indicated the importance of considering anxiety in language learning. They have also pointed out the potential of integrating learning content into gaming contexts. However, few have explored in-depth the learning processes in game-based learning environments while also taking students' learning anxiety into account. To address this issue, a problem-based English listening game was developed, and 77 ninth graders took part in the study by playing the game. A quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate students' learning achievement, learning motivation and English anxiety. In addition, progressive sequential analysis was employed to explore the learning behavioral patterns of students with different levels of English anxiety. According to the three learning phases, it was found that the gaming approach benefited the students' learning achievement and motivation. Moreover, the students with higher levels of English anxiety progressively performed more complex learning and gaming behaviors in the gaming context, and had better learning achievement than those with lower levels of anxiety.

Interactive language learning through speech-enabled virtual scenarios,"Morton H., Gunson N., Jack M.","This paper describes the evaluation of an educational game designed to give learners of foreign languages the opportunity to practice their spoken language skills. Within the speech interactive Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) program, scenarios are presented in which learners interact with virtual characters in the target language using speech recognition technology. Two types of interactive scenarios with virtual characters are presented as part of the game: the one-to-one scenarios which take the form of practice question and answer scenarios where the learner interacts with one virtual character and the interactive scenario which is an immersive contextualised scenario where the learner interacts with two or more virtual characters within the scene to complete a (task-based) communicative goal. The study presented here compares learners' subjective attitudes towards the different scenarios. In addition, the study investigates the performance of the speech recognition component in this game. Forty-eight students of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) took part in the evaluation. Results indicate that learners' subjective ratings for the contextualised interactive scenario are higher than for the one-to-one, practice scenarios. In addition, recognition performance was better for these interactive scenarios. © 2012 Hazel Morton et al.","Inclusion:

Our purpose is to teach students of German or English as a Second Language in the same way that a baby learns a First Language. Children acquire language automatically without overt teaching, without conjugating verbs, looking up dictionaries or taking complex classes in syntax and morphology. They acquire through being immersed in an environment in which they have to learn to communicate in the language in order to achieve a variety of social and personal goals. In this project we provide a mixed environment with real toys for the learner to play with, and a simulated environment and a simulated teacher/caregiver to interact with. Whilst young children may be happy building towers and bridges out of wooden blocks, older children and adults cannot be expected to find motivating goals from the same tasks as a baby tackles as s/he simultaneously learns about the world and his/her language, culture and society.

Learning English Idioms With a Web-Based Educational Game,"Mueller, Amanda; Son, Jeong-Bae; Nozawa, Kazunori; Dashtestani, Reza","This article explores the usefulness of a web-based education game for learning English idioms and examines attitudinal factors contributing to the learning of the idioms with the game. The two studies reported in this article involved two groups of English as a foreign language students in two different contexts. The students were surveyed on their opinions of language learning and games and tested on their idiom knowledge before and after using the web-based educational game over a similar period of gameplay time. The studies found that both groups had significant gains in idiom knowledge, with some variation. It was also found that idiom knowledge improvement was largely mediated by willingness to learn English. In addition, other factors such as satisfaction and self-perception of improvement were noted. It is suggested that, in game-based language learning, attitudinal and motivational factors such as satisfaction with games and willingness to learn with games need to be carefully considered as they can generate positive learning outcomes. Further studies on the use of online educational games for language learning are recommended to be conducted in and out of the classroom in line with the evaluation of the games.","Inclusion:

Learning english through game-based design-reflections on performance and teacher/learner roles,Meyer B.,"In this paper I shall discuss the potential of educational games (Serious Games) for teaching and learning English online focusing on user engagement, performance and design. As suggested by for instance Gee (2004) games can prepare learners for real-life action including social practices that involve language. Gaming may in this sense be understood as a way of performing that involves situated actions and interactions as well as triggers deep engagement and investment on the part of the player. The focus of the paper will be on how the designed space of a platform for learning English as a foreign language in primary school (www.mingoville.com) produces learner participation and learner involvement in the context of a formal learning environment. How do learners respond to the educational design of the platform in question and how do they perform language learning through the game-based design of the platform? How does the role of the teacher facilitate different approaches to language learning in the game-based environment? The paper builds on data from a research project, Serious Games on a Global Market Place (2007-2010) in which the Mingoville.com platform has been studied in the context of English as a foreign language in Danish primary schools. On the basis of the initial results from the pilot project I am proposing that performance and engagement through Serious Games for language learning should be understood in the context of gaming and learning as both separate and interconnected processes.

The paper builds on data from a research project, Serious Games on a Global Market Place in which a platform for learning English as a foreign language in primary school (www.Mingoville.com) has been studied in the context of English as a foreign language in Denmark. On the basis of the initial research results from the project I am proposing that performance and engagement through Serious Games for language learning should be understood in the context of gaming and learning as both separate and interconnected processes. In this connection the mediating role of the teacher is particularly significant. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",,404,2009,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),5940 LNCS,,Scopus
"Mobile and gamified blended learning for language teaching - Studying requirements and acceptance by students, parents and teachers in the wild","Baldauf M., Brandner A., Wimmer C.","While mobile gamified apps for language learning such as Duolingo are highly successful, knowledge about the use and suitability of such concepts for blended learning in schools is scarce. Pursuing a holistic approach, this work investigates the general requirements and acceptance of a modern gamified learning companion for traditional class-based teaching. We conducted several surveys with students, teachers and parents and studied the usage of a custom research prototype by 13/14-year-olds in three classes in English (as a foreign) language under real-world conditions. According to our results, all considered involved parties are positive about such a mobile learning companion when specific requirements are met. We did not observe any community-related negative impact such as teasing for bad results, for example, and conclude that the considered gamification features such as challenges with classmates and rankings are suitable for the investigated school context. Based on the results, we derive a set of guidelines for the design and development of a mobile learning companion, its introduction in class and its practical usage. © 2017 ACM.","Inclusion:

Mobile game based learning based on adaptive curricula and location change,"Frank E., Lackes R., Siepermann M.","With the diffusion of mobile technologies, the classic learning process of class room learning as well as e-learning has changed. Mobile devices enable individuals to learn anywhere and anytime, even if only little time is available. Usually, m-learning is often seen as e-learning on mobile devices. This disregards the real potential of m-learning. Instead, the characteristics of mobility should be taken into account when designing m-learning, namely different places of learning and the process of location change. In this paper, we therefore introduce the concept of location-sequence-based learning (LSBL) that explicitly considers these characteristics. Then, we combine LSBL with the concept of game based learning (GBL) in order to even enhance the motivational aspect of both concepts. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Inclusion:

Mobile learning by the example of the Carnuntum scenario,Lohr M.,"This paper describes the pedagogical and technological approach to the design of learning activities that can be conducted outside the classroom by using mobile devices. The concept was realized by a role-play applied in the collaborative and mobile learning platform COLLAGE, which was developed in the framework of an EU project. The Collage project was co-financed by the European Commission within the framework of eLearning. The game-like scenario enriches the field experience during outdoor excursions in the Archaeological site of Carnuntum. In order to demonstrate that mobile technology games can generate high degrees of engagement and enthusiasm in children the outcomes of the implementation conducted with three classes consisting of 13-year old children, 16-year old pupils and 17-year old students are described. © 2009 IEEE.","Inclusion:

Mythhunter: Gamification in an educational location-based scavenger hunt,"Hutzler A., Wagner R., Pirker J., Gütl C.","Location-based applications have great potential to let users explore the environment in an immersive and engaging way. Digital scavenger hunts have a great potential as teaching and instructional guiding tool. However, many tools only guide users but are not designed as meaningful and engaging experiences. Adding more story-based and exploratory playful game design elements such as quests or achievements can make such experiences and the according learning experiences more entertaining and motivating. This paper contributes by introducing concept and development as well as a qualitative evaluation of an location-based scavenger hunt application with focus on a playful and story-based design. It allows users (e.g. teachers) to create multi-staged quests in a web-based editor, which app-users (e.g. students) can then complete in a platform independent mobile application that makes use of game design elements. In a first qualitative study we focus on evaluating the game with regards to fun, learning factors, usability, and engagement. Results indicate that story-based scavenger hunt applications have a high potential as tool to engage users to learn more about their environment. Especially story-based and playful elements are rated as important element for engaging exploratory experiences. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Inclusion:

No student left behind: a collaborative and competitive game-based learning environment to reduce the achievement gap of EFL students in Taiwan,"Hung, Hui-Chun; Young, Shelley Shwu-Ching; Lin, Chiu-Pin","How to close the achievement gap in the classroom so that no student is left behind becomes one of the most important issues nowadays. This study aims to construct a collaborative and competitive game-based learning environment to improve English proficiencies and reduce the achievement gap for disadvantaged students. The Wireless Crossword Fan-Tan Game (WiCFG) system was implemented to provide teachers with an innovative approach to guide students' learning through a positive involvement with the uses of tablet PCs. The experiment was conducted in an elementary school in Taiwan to investigate whether this approach would facilitate students' learning effectiveness and interactions. Thirty sixth-grade students were randomly assigned into a control group and an experimental group. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from surveys, interviews, observations and video-recordings. The results indicate that integration of the WiCFG system in the collaborative and competitive game-based learning environment leads students to a better interaction between different levels of students. This innovative approach might have the potential to close the achievement gap for disadvantaged students.

Perceptions of Turkish primary school EFL teachers on digital games,"Bedir H., Muftuoglu A.C.","Games have been used in educational fields for a long time, especially in language learning and teaching. Teachers have been using different kinds of games in language classrooms in all levels to motivate learners and foster language learning. Technological developments and the integration of these developments into educational environments have shifted the scope from traditional to a broader aspect. This trend has brought about many changes in the production and usage of the games. Teachers have faced with a relatively new term; educational digital games. Thus, teachers' perceptions on the advantages and disadvantages of integrating educational digital games in language classrooms have become crucial. This study aimed at investigating the perceptions of Turkish primary school EFL teachers on digital games. The scope was to find out their attitudes, knowledge and challenges about digital games. An online survey was used to collect quantitative and qualitative data. A semi-structured interview session was conducted to broaden the scope of understanding the 146 teachers' point of view on digital games. The findings showed that the teachers, despite a few exceptions, were not aware of digital games. They believed that games should be used to reinforce teaching & learning content, yet they did favour the integration of digital games into curriculum due to curriculum constraints. © The Authors, 2016.

Personalized versus normal practice of L2 speaking on Iranian EFL learners’ oral proficiency,Rahmani A.,"Personalized learning is a self-initiated, self-directed or self-prioritized pursuit which gives the learner a degree of choice about the process of learning i.e. what to learn, how to learn and when to learn. Of course personalized learning does not indicate unlimited choice; because, L2 learners will still have targets to be met. However, it provides learners with the opportunity to learn in ways that suit their individual learning styles. The L2 learner should have the opportunity to freely choose a series of activities, already predisposed by the teacher, to improve and develop L2 proficiency. This is because human beings have different ways to learn and process information; and, these different ways of learning are independent of each other. In other words, learning styles and techniques differ across individuals; thus, personalized learning provides L2 learners to freely choose the activities they enjoy the most. So it is a studentcentered learning method in which the interests and the preferences of the learner is taken into account.The present study is an investigation of a personalized versus normal practice of L2 proficiency. For this purpose an OPT (Oxford Placement Test) was given to a total of 80 Iranian EFL learners. Then, 40 of them who were considered as intermediate learners were selected for the purpose of the study. The participants were randomly divided into two groups i.e. an experimental group and a control group. Both groups were pretested prior to the study. Then, the experimental group received the treatment in the form of personalized learning (games-based learning, songs, music, stories, English tongue twisters and the materials that the subjects were most interested in) for ten sessions while the control group received a normal practice of speaking proficiency (based on New Interchange course books). After ten sessions, both groups were post tested. Then the results of the posttests were subjects of statistical analysis (independent-samples t-test). The results indicated that the experimental group did better than the control group and there is a significant difference between the mean scores of the experimental group who were exposed to a personalized learning and the control group who received a normal practice of oral proficiency i.e. a placebo. Based on the results of this study, L2 learner’ interests in carrying out joyful L2 activities can help to reach promising results. © Australian International Academic Centre, Australia.","Inclusion:

Proposal for a conversational English tutoring system that encourages user engagement,"Mazur M., Rzepka R., Araki K.","The need for successful communication between people from different countries has become a growing necessity of modern times. The necessary medium for cross-cultural communication, English, has gained the status of an international language. In our paper propose a free-talking dialogue system designed for tutoring English as a second language. We also discuss the development and capabilities of such conversational agent and possible applications. Among the key features of such system we emphasize the principals of gamification, a notion of integrating game mechanics into non-game systems, applications and services in order to encourage user interaction. Next, we present the novel idea of teaching foreign languages to users by sentential context-learning method. Finally, we underline the importance of emotion recognition by introducing a potential foundation for verifying the assumption that certain words containing emotional content can improve learning.",,404,2011,"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Computers in Education, ICCE 2011",,,Scopus

Satisfaction of high school students with a mobile game-based English learning system,"Tsai C.-H., Cheng C.-H., Yeh D.-Y., Lin S.-Y.","This study investigated the satisfaction of high school students with a mobile game-based English learning system. The system, called the Happy English Learning System (HELS), integrates learning material into a gamebased context and was constructed and installed on mobile devices to conduct an experiment over a period of eight weeks. The experimental sample comprised 38 students. Through statistical analysis, the results confirmed the merits of a mobile game-based approach for high school students learning English. The findings included the following: (1) the adoption of a familiar, but challenging game design is a critical technical factor; (2) the students that were more interested in learning English were more satisfied with this approach; (3) regardless to what extent the students were interested in playing games or enjoyed playing the HELS, they acknowledged satisfaction with the system and the learning process; and (4) the more time the studentsspent playing the HELS per week, the more satisfied they were with the system and the learning process.

SERIOUS GAME MOTIVATION IN AN EFL CLASSROOM IN CHINESE PRIMARY SCHOOL,"Anyaegbu, Ruphina; Ting (Jessy), Wei; Yi Li","This paper is a report on the findings of a qualitative PhD pilot research study on the integration of Serious Games specifically Mingoville to motivate the Chinese primary students in an EFL classrooms. It was carried out in two primary schools: the students are both from low and high income families respectively in Jiangsu Province, PR, China. Content analyses techniques were used to analyze the transcript of which the researcher systematically works through each transcript assigning codes using numbers to specific characteristics within the text, the categories emerged from data by reading through each transcript as well as from literature reviews. The findings identified the differences on how Mingoville motivated the students in the two schools. It revealed some mitigating factors that affected the student's full motivation when Mingoville was integrated in their English learning classroom. The findings indicate that teachers and parent's attitude are key factors to consider for a successful game based learning.

Serious games and english as a foreign language in primary school - A policy perspective,"Meyer B., Sørensen B.H.","In this paper we use the example of a recent study of a game based platform for English teaching and learning (www.mingoville.com) to discuss the role of game based learning in primary school viewed from the perspective of policy. We understand English teaching and learning as an increasingly significant aspect of the ways in which nation states participate and compete in global education contexts and how they forge educated citizens. In addition to this we argue that digital media often are conceptualised by government policies as agents of change and reform that connect strongly with the aim of educating competent English speakers for the global community. In the paper we shall focus mainly on data which have been produced in connection with a research project called Serious Games on a Global Market Place (2007-11). Data have been collected at various levels of national and local government through interviews with actors involved in policy making. We approach the issue of policy through three case studies of educational policy in Denmark, Portugal and Vietnam. These case studies are interpreted through a variety of primarily anthropological theories that understand policy as complex articulations of cultural and social ideas of the educated person (Levinson & Holland 1996, Shore & Wright 1997).","Inclusion:

Structure Dynamic Response Optimization under Equivalent Static Loads of Each Node Based on Mode Superposition,"Mao H., Dong X., Guo B., Wang Q.","According to the complexity of the transient dynamic analysis and the uncertainty of equivalent static load, the equivalent static load method (ESLM) of each node based on mode superposition was put forward, which was applied to the dynamics response optimization. Firstly, the relationship between the dynamic response and each mode was analyzed based on the principle of mode superposition. Then, the principle of equivalent static load method was analyzed in detail, and the calculation formula of equivalent static load (ESL) of each node using modal response was determined. Lastly, ESLM of each node in the critical point set was proposed, and the time critical points were obtained by using the spectral element discrete interpolation and the differential is equal to zero, which the critical time point sets are composed of the adjacent GLL (Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre) points. The dynamic response size optimization of 124 bar truss structures and the hybrid size and shape optimization of 18 bar truss structures were used to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2017, Beijing China Science Journal Publishing Co.

Taking an instrumental genesis lens: New insights into collaborative mobile learning,"Pargman, Teresa Cerratto; Nouri, Jalal; Milrad, Marcelo","In this paper, we argue that in order to gain a deeper understanding of collaborative mobile learning in schools, it is important to know not only how mobile devices affect collaborative learning but also how collaborative learning emerges and is mediated by these devices. We develop our argument by applying the instrumental genesis theory and the collective instrumented activities and situations model for the analysis of learners' collaborative learning in the tablet-mediated classroom. This analysis is grounded in data collected in four elementary Swedish schools (ie, from fourth to eighth grade). From the data, we considered the learners' conversation in English as a foreign language, inquiry-based learning in the natural sciences classroom and game-based learning in the arithmetic classroom. On the one hand, the scrutiny of these specific activities led us to distinguish the pragmatic, epistemic, and reflexive instrumental mediations that have already been theorized in the instrumental genesis theory. On the other hand, they helped us to identify two additional ones, which we call emotional and spatial. Based on these findings, we claim that collaboration in the tablet-mediated classroom is a complex activity that emerges from a variety of instrumental mediations that configure contemporary collaborative mobile learning.","Inclusion:

Teachers can be involved in the design of location-based learning games: The use of the puzzle board metaphor,"Melero J., Hernández-Leo D., Blat J.","Recent research in the Game-Based Learning domain shows that location-based games can lead to positive effects in students' motivation and engagement. However, the potential effectiveness of these approaches depends on to what extent their design is aligned with the requirements of specific educational situations. For this reason, involving teachers in the design of their own location-based learning games becomes crucial to fulfil their teaching requirements. This paper presents a metaphor based on puzzle boards as a technique to involve teachers in the design of their own location-based games. A design-based research methodology has been followed to evaluate the proposed metaphor. Previous research experiments have shown the feasibility of the puzzle-based games approach to allow secondary education teachers the design of these types of learning experiences. However, some issues in terms of understanding specific elements of the proposed metaphor were detected. A second iteration of the research methodology is described in the paper to evaluate the changes made to the definitions of the metaphor's elements and the dynamics of the game design task. The evaluation is carried out with 20 primary and secondary education teachers who completed a paper-based design task. The main findings show that teachers did not have problems using the proposed metaphor and they successfully designed their own location-based learning games.","Inclusion:

Teachers' thoughts on the integration of computer games in the ESL classroom in Nigeria,Anyaegbu R.,"This paper is part of an ongoing PHD project on the integration of an educational computer game called Mingoville in teaching and learning English as a second language in two private primary schools in Nigeria. The paper reports a qualitative study of teachers' thoughts on the integration of the Mingoville game carried out to discover teachers' reactions to the use of educational computer games as a learning tool in the English language curriculum in Nigeria. The paper identifies factors that might hinder the acceptance of education computer games in learning English as a second language in Nigeria primary schools. It also recommends strategies to solve the challenges presented by the teachers. English language has occupied a premier position in Nigeria for many years, so English has enjoyed an unchallenged position in Nigerian education. However, a World Bank report found that Nigerian graduates have low proficiency in English. They stated that the 22% unemployment rate in the metropolitan areas in Nigeria is a result of poor quality of the graduates, particularly in communication skills. According to them, these graduates exhibit ""poor abilities in the oral and written expression in English language. Recognizing these problems, there is a need to think about the education methodology that will suit the young generation to master English skills. According to Prensky, (2001) contemporary learners think and learn differently because they have grown up exposed to digital gaming environments for both pleasure, learning, and games, elicit motivation and provide the experience of engagement. He argues for changing the present learning environment from the predominantly ""tell test"" framework currently employed by a majority of educational institutions to ones that harness the potential of digital game based learning. The question remains, though regarding, how Nigerian primary school teachers perceive and accept the integration of educational computer games in teaching English as a second language? Education computer game is a new phenomenon in teaching and learning English as a second language in Nigeria. Egenfeldt-Nelsen (2006), the role of the teacher is crucial in achieving the learning outcomes from game based classroom be it declarative or affective. Egenfeldt-Nelsen (2006), The integration of computer games depends on the attitudes of teachers, so it is necessary to understand teachers' thoughts, acceptance and understanding of this innovation in teaching and learning. The findings of this study will help the teachers to learn more about the best strategies to motivate the students to learn English and to understand their own changing role in a digital classroom. The teachers will also be motivated as they see their students increased interest in learning English.",,404,2010,"4th European Conference on Games Based Learning 2010, ECGBL 2010",,,Scopus
Teaching articles to ESL learners with GBL and scaffolding,Gillian E.,"Teaching the use of the English articles a, an, and the in written sentences to teenage Polish students is a very difficult teaching task as the Polish language expresses these concepts in very different ways to English (Arabski 1979, Ekiert 2005, Zabor 2011). The aim of current research is to employ the Game Based Learning (GBL) approach combined with the cognitive-based approach of scaffolding (Vygotsky 1978), to ameliorate these difficulties and aid the students' learning of these concepts. In this paper, the development of an e-learning tool (Gillian 2012-2014) will be outlined. The paper will discuss how the Adaptive and Reusable Educational Game (AREG model) (Zarraonandia et al. 2012) and Vygotsky's cognitive approach will be utilised in this tool. Through the use of these components and this tool, a more individualised, effective, and motivating game experience will be designed for a wider range of English as Second Language (ESL) learners. © Peter Lang GmbH.

The added value of a gaming context and intelligent adaptation for a mobile learning application for vocabulary learning,"Sandberg, Jacobijn; Maris, Marinus; Hoogendoorn, Pepijn","Two groups participated in a study on the added value of a gaming context and intelligent adaptation for a mobile learning application. The control group worked at home for a fortnight with the original Mobile English Learning application (MEL-original) developed in a previous project. The experimental group worked at home for a fortnight with MEL-enhanced, the original application embedded in an adventure game and augmented with intelligent adaptation. Two learning themes were used: Zoo animals and Neighbourhood. Both groups attended lessons at school on Zoo Animals and Neighbourhood during the same periods they were allowed to work with the application at home. A pre- and post-test were conducted to establish the initial vocabulary knowledge and the knowledge acquired during the learning phase. The main results indicated that the students in the experimental condition (MEL-enhanced) outperformed the children from the control group (MEL-original), although the former group did not spend more time with the learning material than the latter, and that the students in the experimental group valued MEL-enhanced more than the children from the control group valued MEL-original.

The design of a web 2.0 based vocabulary learning system for EFL learners,"Zhang W., Qiu F.","Vocabulary is essential to language proficiency and skills. However, vocabulary learning is tedious and difficult for most EFL learners due to the forgetfulness and the discrete nature of vocabulary. Although many learning strategies have been proposed for vocabulary learning, the great effort required prohibits ELF learners to apply them. To make the vocabulary learning as a social activity with fun, a web 2.0 based vocabulary learning system is designed in the paper. The content-centered model, flash-based educational game and mind-map view, together with those learning strategies that have been proved effective make the system collaborative, interactive, motivating and self-involved for ELF learner.

The design of IWB-based DGBL activities model for EFL preschoolers,"Huang Y.-H., Chuang T.-Y.","Digital game-based learning (DGBL) has successfully brought traditional game-based learning (GBL) into a new horizon due to its multimedia features, high interactivity, immediate and various feedbacks, authentic and vicarious contexts, etc. As a result, PC-based DGBL has been prevalent in the past decade. In terms of socio-cultural theory, however, PC-based DGBL has some drawbacks in nature to effectively create social interactions among learners in the classroom. The dynamics of DGBL in the classroom setting mainly relies upon learners fervent interactions to stimulate cooperation, collaboration, problem-solving, communication, and competition in the game context. The characteristics of interactive whiteboard (IWB) exactly solve the issue of adopting DGBL in the classroom. Therefore, IWB-based DGBL has been increasingly applied in the classroom setting in recent years. Nevertheless, not all instructors can put them into effective practice. Without effective teachers carefully planning curricula and conducting classroom activities, any fantastic tools and materials can become just fancy artifacts. Hence, this study aims to tackle these problems, particularly for EFL preschoolers, by proposing a model of IWB-based DGBL instructional activities based upon Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) approach, and suggesting several principles of implementing this model for EFL preschool teachers. © 2012 IEEE.","Inclusion:

The effect of an augmented reality board game on english vocabulary development,"Lantavou O., Fesakis G.","The process of vocabulary learning is a very complex one. Teachers have made tremendous efforts to tackle the difficulty of learning, retaining and using new vocabulary. The endless possibilities of game-based learning have a lot to offer in English Language Teaching (ELT). Furthermore, AR has emerged as an interesting tool in educational research. Combined with educational games, AR is a powerful tool. Lately, except from the cognitive aspects in EFL learning the emotional factors have come under research. This study attempts to investigate the effects that a board game for learning vocabulary has on learners. In the context of the research, an innovative board game was designed, in a conventional and an AR enhanced version, for vocabulary development. Two groups of students took part in this research. One group played the conventional version of the game while the other the version enhanced with AR. Pre-tests and Post-tests were taken and two questionnaires were used as well. The first one, is a user experience questionnaire created by Huang (2018) and the second is a combination of the PLEXQ questionnaire (Boberg 2015) and the researchers own questions.

The effect of augmented reality games on English as foreign language motivation,Taskiran A.,"Today, educational practices are being designed and varied due to advance of millennium generation who tend to use mobile technologies in every aspect of their lives. Accordingly, growing interest towards mobile learning in education brings several opportunities and advantages for English as foreign language teachers and learners. Augmented reality, which is another growing phenomenon on mobile devices, is a technology that incorporates digital information such as images, video, and audio into real-world spaces. As a part of mobile learning, augmented reality technique has potential to facilitate learning through enjoyment over learning tasks, engagement and motivation. Designed in descriptive survey model, this study intended to assess English as a foreign language learners’ subjective experience regarding the implementation of augmented reality-based learning materials in their language classes with a game-based approach in Anadolu University, Turkey. The analysis of the questionnaire items showed that most of the students accepted the activities in augmented learning environment highly motivating and enjoyable, which is common in augmented reality research. © The Author(s) 2018.","Inclusion:

The Effect of Computer Game-Based Learning on FL Vocabulary Transferability,"Franciosi, Stephan J.","In theory, computer game-based learning can support several vocabulary learning affordances that have been identified in the foreign language learning research. In the observable evidence, learning with computer games has been shown to improve performance on vocabulary recall tests. However, while simple recall can be a sign of learning, observation of skill application in communication is a better indicator of skill mastery. Further, observing this use in separate communicative contexts could constitute evidence of transferability of skills. Hence, this paper presents the results of two investigations of learning outcomes in EFL classes at a Japanese university using computer game-based lessons. The first study was a quasi-experiment comparing use of targeted words in a writing task between a group of students who participated in a computer game-based lesson, and a group of students who did not. The second study was a cross sectional analysis comparing use of targeted vocabulary in a writing task with amount of participation in computer game-based lessons. The results suggest that computer game-based approaches to foreign language education in real-world classrooms can improve transferability of learned vocabulary.","Inclusion:

The effect of length of exposure to CALL technology on young Iranian EFL learners' grammar gain,"Sadeghi K., Dousti M.","In the twenty-first century, integration of technology into education is a force worthy of contemplation. Among all the possible technological tools that can be integrated into EFL classes, computers seem to have achieved a more dominant position. One of the outstanding features of computers is their potential to present educational games and to add fun to grammar learning. This study investigated the possible effects of the integration of CALL technology on young Iranian elementary EFL learners' grammar gain. Moreover, it examined the role of length of exposure to find an optimum balance for the proper amount of CALL integration to language activities. One control and two experimental groups, each consisted of 15 participants, were engaged. One of the experimental groups used CALL technology for twice as long as the other group. 'Family and Friends 2' with its accompanying MultiRom was utilized in the experimental groups. This software presented computer-based grammar activities. All the participants tried their answers in separate immediate as well as delayed post-tests. The results of one way ANOVA demonstrated significant differences between control and experimental groups in the immediate post-test. The findings of the delayed post-test showed that a significant difference did exist between the control group and the second experimental group. Furthermore, the length of exposure was found to be influential. The results of this study provide some insights for teachers and administrators to review their curricula, approaches, and educational tools, and to consider the possibility of incorporating CALL technology into their teaching environments.","Inclusion:

A survey formerly developed by Yu-Hsin (1999) was adapted and administered to 100 foreign language learners studying at two state universities' English language preparatory schools. Also, participants' written responses were collected to understand the qualities attributed to the effective teacher. Results show that an effective teacher is a friendly, young, enthusiastic, creative, and humorous person whose gender is not important. Also, students expect the teacher to be a native speaker of Turkish, but fluent in English, someone who likes to play educational games, and who teaches grammar effectively by using real life situations to explain language items.

The game had been altered to include a number of quests for learners to complete. To gauge the effects of playing the games, participants' language use in both text and voice chats was recorded and analysed. Game play resulted in a large and significant increase in English interaction that used a wider range of discourse functions, and also resulted in significantly more frequent contributions compared with English interaction in class. We discuss some of the theoretical and pedagogical implications of these findings.","Inclusion:

The game genre factor in computer games based learning,Wiklund M.,"As the usage of commercial, off-the-shelf computer games as teaching tools are being discussed and empirically studied, the varying properties of different game genres is an important factor that should be taken into account. The possible impact on study results that may be inherent from game genres as such is an issue that needs to be studied in order to assess the potential of using commercial games in a learning situation. To obtain more information on the impact of game genre on a learning environment, an interview study was conducted. Students undertaking their 10:th and 11:th year of study as part of a test project using commercial off-the-shelf computer games of their own choosing as the main teaching tool, were interviewed about their favourite game genres. This was correlated with their study results in the subject of English (as a second language), for students favouring FPS (First Person Shooter) games versus MMORPG:s (Massively Multiplayer On-line Role-Playing Games). Results show that students with MMORPG:s as their favourite game genre (with or without other genres in conjunction) received a higher average number of yearly grades in English (as a second language) than students with FPS games as their favourite game genre. © 2006 The University of Wolverhampton.","Inclusion:

THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR COMPLEX EMERGENCY IN GAMES: A STUDY ON OPPORTUNITIES OF LEARNING IN THESE SOCIAL PRACTICES,"Fidelis Braga, Junia de Carvalho; Soares de Souza, Valeska Virginia","In this paper, we look into (i) the reasons that lead students of two public schools to use games, (ii) the presence of the conditions required for complex emergence of knowledge in game elements, and (iii) the role these conditions play in their learning, especially learning English. The ensuing discussions will be based on complexity principles, which address the conditions for the emergence of learning and on the literature about learning through games. The analysis of the questionnaire-generated corpus indicates that research participants prefer games that favor decision-making and enable them to define not only what but also how to learn. These games present dynamics commonly found in the conditions for complex emergence that create opportunities to learn various skills, including English learning strategies. Our findings indicate that students also learn from educational games although these games do not present all the necessary emergence complex conditions nor do they appeal to most students.","Inclusion:

This study investigates the level of emerging technologies use in teaching English as a foreign language for primary school settings. English language learning, especially as a foreign language, is not limited to any particular age group. However, the focus could be different for primary school students as they are in the critical period of language acquisition. Twenty full time-teachers participated in the study and filled out questionnaires provided and developed to measure the use of emerging technologies in supporting oral skill, developing young learner’s literacy and digital game-based learning. The questionnaire was mainly focused on the frequency, quality and diversity of emerging technologies use in teaching English language. The results of data analysis revealed that teachers tend to use ICT for supporting students’ oral skill instead of developing students’ literacy. It was also found that teachers with better computer literacy seem to use ICT in the classroom than teacher’s with low computer literacy. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",,404,2017,Advanced Science Letters,23,2,Scopus
The utility of the grem model in designing an empirically researched e-learning tool,"Gillian E., Zarraonandia T.","E-learning tools are being used in second language teaching. The design of the tools is often based on programming and gamification perspectives, not pedagogical perspectives. The e-learning tool presented in this article employed the Games Rules ScEnario Model (GREM) (Zarraonandia et al., 2015) in its design. This model looks at game design from a programming perspective and a learning theory perspective. Thus, the model can incorporate well-researched cognitive/pedagogical theories such as form-focused instruction, comprehensible input, scaffolding, simple and complex chunking, and corrective feedback. An innovative and interactive game-based learning tool for teaching English article use was built employing the GREM approach and the cognitive/pedagogical theories mentioned. The tool’s effectiveness was tested on a sample of thirty Polish EFL students aged 13 to 14 years over a 10 week period. The students were randomly allocated to an experimental group (n = 14) and a control group (n =16). The former used the e-learning tool; whereas, the latter received in-class instruction only. Each group completed a pre-test stage, a teaching phase, and a post-test stage. Results of the t-test analysis revealed that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group (at α = 0.05) in the overall results for appropriate use of English articles in the major usage contexts within English sentences. The results provide valuable quantitative evidence for utility of the GREM approach for designing e-learning tools that incorporate empirically-researched pedagogical and cognitive design elements. © 2018, Dechema e.V.

Towards an efficient mobile learning games design model,"Karoui A., Marfisi-Schottman I., George S.","Classrooms are increasingly equipped with information and communication technology and especially interactive mobile devices. However, the latest studies show that their use by teachers is still very limited because of a lack of resources and applications adapted to an educational use. Indeed, there seems to be a shortage of mobile learning practitioners due to the time required for these tools' apprehension. Likewise, studies show real needs to expand the variety of applications, resources and activities available on these mobile devices, in order to make them more suited to the teachers' pedagogic objectives. Concurrently, new ways of using mobile devices for education are arising. Among those directions of use, research conducted on Mobile Learning Games (MLGs) seems particularly promising. In this paper, we propose to identify several MLGs, from the most referenced scientific assessments, that have been carried out in educational context, in order to determine their common features and impact on learners, and to identify challenges in terms of design, storyboarding and student monitoring. Thus, we can discuss how far research on MLGs has gone in terms of pedagogical effectiveness and whether there are still challenges that teachers will be facing regarding the design and execution of MLGs. At this level, we try to define the main characteristics of the analysed MLGs, and identify the recurring problems that occur when teachers use them. First, this will allow us to establish several guidelines for designing MLGs. Secondly, in order to diminish the constraints of use, we discuss new ways of implementing MLGs. Furthermore, we propose a global MLGs model, capable of capitalizing the identified main characteristics and overcoming the recurring problems at the same time. Finally, we discuss the possibility of implementing this model through an authoring environment.","Inclusion:

Unmasking the Mystique: Utilizing Narrative Character-Playing Games to Support English Language Fluency,"Killham, Jennifer E.; Saligman, Adam; Jette, Kelli","This classroom-based action research study investigated the creative implementation of fluency instruction for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners through the use of a virtual character-playing simulation called Place Out of Time (POOT). The researchers sought to identify what supported and impeded student participation in this game-based learning environment. Participants included 35 ninth grade students at a highly ranked university preparatory school in Eastern Europe. This study employed narrative inquiry, drawing from game discourse (e.g., participant observations), surrounding discourse (e.g., classroom observation) and meta discourse, (e.g., interviews, focus groups, and post-activity reflection papers). Thematic analysis revealed the students' desires for an increase in academic rigor related to POOT instruction. Four sub-themes pertaining to academic rigor emerged: content legitimacy, accountability, website functionality, and dynamic interactions. Subsequently, the authors advise classroom teachers to consider several crucial factors when instituting creative fluency instruction with high-achieving EFL students: exercise precaution when labeling learning environments as ""games;"" apportion feedback that is frequent, contextualized, and consequential; and oversee and redirect non-participation.",,404,2016,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GAME-BASED LEARNING,6,4,WOS
Using audio in location-based educational games,Kristiansen E.,"In connection with the new geological museum at Møns Klint in Denmark, an education centre was established. This teaches school classes about the special nature in the area, particularly the famous chalk cliffs on the eastern coast of the island, where the museum is located. Together with the ""Danish Forest and Nature Agency,"" and the education centre of the museum, we designed a game to teach children aged 13 and up, the special nature found on the cliff. As the education centre already offers guided tours, the problem was to design a game that would take the children and adults out on their own or in small groups, using familiar technology like the mobile phone, but in a new way. It was also considered important that the technology should ""stay in the background"" - that is, require a minimum of hands-on interaction and if possible, not use a screen at all. This would free the players to concentrate on the nature of the site and on the game. To meet these requirements a location-based game called ""Klintespillet"" was designed. As almost all location-based games use the players' mobile device to show a map on the screen, the challenge was to design an audio-only or audio-mostly location-based game. Audio is used widespread in games, but few games rely on audio as a primary means of communication. Using audio in location-based games is even more interesting, as game audio can be enjoyed without disturbing the visual experience of the place. Game audio may provide the player with an audio experience, that mix various kinds of audio with the soundscape of the location in a number of ways. On the other hand designing a game without using visuals and with a minimum of keyboard interaction is a challenge. This was explored in the location-based game called ""Klintespillet,"" based on a site-specific narrative built on the folklore and special features of the site. This resulted in a prototype that was evaluated using qualitative methods. Evaluation showed that an audio-only location-based game may not be desirable, but that an audio-mostly location-based game may create an immersive game space, which is an interesting platform for location-based learning.",,404,2010,"4th European Conference on Games Based Learning 2010, ECGBL 2010",,,Scopus
Using augmented reality to teach kindergarten students english vocabulary,"Lee L.-K., Chau C.-H., Chau C.-H., Ng C.-T.","Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that augments the real physical world with computer-generated 3D virtual objects such that the users can interact with them using the screen of their mobile devices. This paper studies how to effectively use AR to enhance the learning experience of kindergarten students, while addressing parents' concern that a long-time usage of electronic devices may affect their child's health. We developed an AR mobile application prototype to teach kindergarten students English vocabulary in an interactive and attractive way. It allows kindergarten students to learn English vocabulary in any place and at any time using a mobile device. To address the parents' concern on health, we integrate a monitoring system into the application, which allows the parents to monitor their child's usage and stop the application in real time online. Preliminary evaluation shows that the effectiveness of the application is satisfactory. It is beneficial to use augmented reality for early childhood education if the usage time of the students is well monitored. © 2017 IEEE.","Inclusion:

Using digital games as a learning and teaching tool in hong kong classrooms,"Hui C., Tam F.","Digital game-based learning is becoming a new trend for teaching and learning. While it has been developing in some countries for years, it is still a relatively new topic in others. The recent Hong Kong education system needs a transformation in the teaching and learning mode and digital games can play an important role. With the increasing popularity of digital games and rapid growth of needs in using information technology in the classrooms, this paper aims at looking into the local situation and the potential educational games market in Hong Kong with an example of a locally developed educational game.",,404,2011,"Proceedings of the 14th IASTED International Conference on Computers and Advanced Technology in Education, CATE 2011",,,Scopus
Using native tongue mnemonics to enhance English learning,"Safi M.I., Badillo-Urquiola K., Shahid S., Mahmood H., Haider M., Zaheer Z.","An individual's language and culture play an important part in their learning process [9]. In this paper, we develop a mobile application called “Mnemorizer” to help international students learn English vocabulary for standardized tests. We use mnemonics and gamification to aid learning and present results that indicate that native tongue mnemonics are more effective than mnemonics in English. Initial results of this ongoing project provide motivation for our future work, which will leverage crowdsourcing techniques to build a database of mnemonic devices to support a broader subset of languages and cultures. © 2018 Copyright is held by the","Inclusion:

Using ubiquitous games in an English listening and speaking course: Impact on learning outcomes and motivation,"Liu, Tsung-Yu; Chu, Yu-Ling","This paper reports the results of a study which aimed to investigate how ubiquitous games influence English learning achievement and motivation through a context-aware ubiquitous learning environment. An English curriculum was conducted on a school campus by using a context-aware ubiquitous learning environment called the Handheld English Language Learning Organization (HELLO). HELLO helps students to engage in learning activities based on the ARCS motivation theory, involving various educational strategies, including ubiquitous game-based learning, collaborative learning, and context-aware learning. Two groups of students participated in the learning activities prescribed in a curriculum by separately using ubiquitous game-based learning and non-gaming learning. The curriculum, entitled 'My Campus', included three learning activities, namely 'Campus Environment', 'Campus Life' and 'Campus Story'. Participants included high school teachers and juniors. During the experiment, tests, a survey, and interviews were conducted for the students. The evaluation results of the learning outcomes and learning motivation demonstrated that incorporating ubiquitous games into the English learning process could achieve a better learning outcomes and motivation than using non-gaming method. They further revealed a positive relationship between learning outcomes and motivation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Inclusion:

VIRGE: Tutoring English over the Web through a game,"Virvou M., Katsionis G.",We have developed a virtual reality (VR) game for tutoring English as a foreign language over the Web. The educational game is called VIRGE (virtual reality game for English) and intends to motivate and engage students through the use of a game. We have shown how an ILTS may be combined with the technology of virtual reality games and used over the Web for teaching English as a second language. The benefits of the combination of the above technologies are particularly important for the domain of a foreign language teaching because they allow the creation of engaging and motivating educational applications that are cross-cultural. © 2003 IEEE.,"Inclusion:

Vocabulary and grammar gain through computer educational games,"Jalali S., Dousti M.","The increasing use of computers in the past thirty years has encouraged many to investigate their effectiveness as instructional tools. The unquestionable presence of computers in all aspects of human life and the inner desire of human beings to enjoy learning through the use of computer educational games prompt the integration of computer-based games in EFL teaching and learning environments. This study investigated the effect of computer educational games on Iranian elementary learners' grammar and vocabulary gain. A total of 58 female, who were selected out of 80 elementary institute EFL learners participated in the study. Their age range is between 13-15 one experimental and one control group took part in this study. The study followed a quasi-experimental pre- and post-test design. In order to compare the results of their performance, an independent samples t-test was conducted. In comparing the pre-test and post-test scores, the results demonstrated no significant differences between the experimental and control groups. However, the involvement of all learners, their enthusiasm to use the new technology in language learning and learners' positive attitudes toward learning was apparent in the experimental group. The presence of such a high motivation among the learners in experimental group could contribute to their active involvement in the process of learning. This implies that computers have a significant role in motivating learners' involvement in the learning process.","Inclusion:

VocaMono: An online multiplayer English vocabulary learning board game,"Lo J.-J., Hsin C.-K.","It is imperative to construct a learning environment to make EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners have an engaged vocabulary learning experience to enhance their learning interests. Recently, digital game-based learning suggests a new learning paradigm of learning by playing within visual and interesting environments. As a consequence, this study developed an online multiplayer English vocabulary learning board game, named VocaMono (short for Vocabulary Monopoly), for English vocabulary learning. Adapted from the famous games Monopoly, Unscramble, and Scrabble, this study developed VacaMono by effectively integrating the gameplay and pedagogy designs for vocabulary learning. VocaMono has been designed to have unique educational game characteristics that should be of interest to vocabulary learning. It enhances learners' motivation for learning and memorizing English vocabulary. By playing this educational game, players' are able to enhance their vocabulary acquisition abilities not only for correctly spelling taught vocabulary but also for discovering spelling patterns. This game can fit players' vocabulary levels by selecting words from the word scope. Furthermore, this game is possible to be used to correspond to the class progresses.","Inclusion:

VR-Based Gamification of Communication Training and Oral Examination in a Second Language,"Reitz, Liesa; Sohny, Aline; Lochmann, Gerrit","The authors present a novel way of oral language training by embedding the English as a foreign language (EFL) learning process into a generic 3D Cooperative Virtual Reality (VR) Game. Due to lack of time, resources and innovation, the language classroom is limited in its possibilities of promoting authentic communication. Therefore, the researchers investigated how to induce a VR setting with information gaps, for which they designed a template which intrinsically promotes communication and the students' confidence in using EFL. Thereby, VR enables the simulation of real life situations, creating both comfortable and authentic training environments. The game content is based on the internationally approved Graded Examination in Spoken English (GESE) Trinity Exam and can be adapted to the needs of the learners or the given curricula. The empirical analysis shows that the designed game trains the students' communication skills, evoking a high amount of speech and a qualitative linguistic output.","Inclusion:
